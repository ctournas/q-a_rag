            "Το GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) είναι η τέταρτη γενιά ενός μεγάλου πολυτροπικού μοντέλου γλώσσας που δημιουργήθηκε από την OpenAI. Κυκλοφόρησε στις 14 Μαρτίου 2023 και είναι διαθέσιμο μέσω API και για χρήστες ChatGPT Plus. Η Microsoft επιβεβαίωσε ότι οι εκδόσεις του Bing που χρησιμοποιούν GPT στην πραγματικότητα χρησιμοποιούσαν το GPT-4 πριν από την επίσημη κυκλοφορία του. Ως μετασχηματιστής, το GPT-4 ήταν προεκπαιδευμένο για την πρόβλεψη του επόμενου διακριτικού (χρησιμοποιώντας δημόσια δεδομένα και «δεδομένα με άδεια από τρίτους παρόχους») και στη συνέχεια βελτιστοποιήθηκε με ενισχυτική μάθηση από την ανάδραση ανθρώπου και τεχνητής νοημοσύνης για ανθρώπινη ευθυγράμμιση και πολιτική συμμόρφωση.\n",
            "Οι New York Times έγραψαν ότι το GPT-4 έδειξε μεγάλες βελτιώσεις στην ακρίβεια σε σύγκριση με το GPT-3.5, είχε αποκτήσει τη δυνατότητα να συνοψίζει και να σχολιάζει εικόνες, ήταν σε θέση να συνοψίζει περίπλοκα κείμενα, πέρασε σε εξετάσεις bar και πολλά τυποποιημένα τεστ, αλλά παρόλα αυτά έδειξε μια τάση για παραισθήσεις απαντήσεις.\n",

Ο οργανισμός παρήγαγε δύο εκδόσεις του GPT-4 με παράθυρα περιβάλλοντος 8192 και 32768 μάρκες, μια σημαντική βελτίωση σε σχέση με τα GPT-3.5 και GPT-3, τα οποία περιορίστηκαν σε 4096 και 2048 διακριτικά αντίστοιχα. Σε αντίθεση με τον προκάτοχό του, το GPT-4 μπορεί να λαμβάνει εικόνες καθώς και κείμενο ως είσοδο.\n",
            "Η OpenAI υιοθέτησε μια κλειστή προσέγγιση όσον αφορά τις τεχνικές λεπτομέρειες του GPT-4. η τεχνική έκθεση απέφυγε ρητά να προσδιορίσει το μέγεθος του μοντέλου, την αρχιτεκτονική, το υλικό ή τη μέθοδο εκπαίδευσης, εκτός από το γεγονός ότι χρησιμοποιεί ενισχυτική μάθηση από ανατροφοδότηση από ανθρώπους και τεχνητή νοημοσύνη. Η έκθεση ισχυρίστηκε ότι «το ανταγωνιστικό τοπίο και οι επιπτώσεις στην ασφάλεια των μοντέλων μεγάλης κλίμακας» ήταν παράγοντες που επηρέασαν αυτή την απόφαση. Ο ακριβής αριθμός παραμέτρων του GPT-4 παραμένει άγνωστος, αλλά το The Verge ανέφερε φήμες ότι το GPT-4 θα αύξανε σημαντικά τον αριθμό παραμέτρων από τα 175 δισεκατομμύρια του GPT-3 στα 100 τρισεκατομμύρια. Ο Διευθύνων Σύμβουλος της OpenAI, Sam Altman, περιέγραψε αυτές τις φήμες ως «μαλακίες».\n",
            "Οι αντιπρόσωποι των ΗΠΑ Don Beyer και Ted Lieu επιβεβαίωσαν στους New York Times ότι ο Altman επισκέφτηκε το Κογκρέσο τον Ιανουάριο του 2023 για να επιδείξει το GPT-4 και τους βελτιωμένους «έλεγχους ασφαλείας« του σε σύγκριση με άλλα μοντέλα AI.\n",

Στις 17 Μαρτίου, η Microsoft ανακοίνωσε την περαιτέρω ενσωμάτωση του GPT-4 στα προϊόντα της, αποκαλύπτοντας το Microsoft 365 Copilot, «ενσωματωμένο στις εφαρμογές που χρησιμοποιούν εκατομμύρια άνθρωποι καθημερινά: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams και άλλα».\n",
            "Το Duolingo πρόσθεσε το GPT-4 στην εφαρμογή του και πρόσθεσε δύο νέες δυνατότητες, το «Roleplay» και το «Explain My Answer». Προς το παρόν λειτουργεί μόνο για αγγλόφωνους που μαθαίνουν γαλλικά ή ισπανικά.\n",
            "Η ισλανδική start-up Miðeind ehf, που εργάζεται στη διατήρηση της γλώσσας, επιλέχθηκε από την OpenAI ως μία από τις 6 εταιρείες που θα συμμετάσχουν στο πρόγραμμα δοκιμών πρώιμης beta του νέου μοντέλου.\n",
